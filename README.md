# Deserializer
My understanding on serialization and deserialization:

1.Serialization: The process of converting data into blocks of bytes for the ease of storage, security and transmission is termed as serialization. 

2.In my understanding, it is somewhat similar to encoding data for security purposes. 

3.Every encoded file, needs a key for it to be decoded or else thereâ€™s just gibberish which is impossible to understand.

4.Similar to decoding, in block-chain we have deserialization. 

5.Deserialization: It is the exact opposite to serialization, the process of reconstruction of the serialized data for it start making sense again is known as deserialization. 

As per my understanding, keeping in mind the time limitations I came up with a code to deserialize the most basic serialized pattern.
